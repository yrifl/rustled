# Rustled

This is my complete Rust template, for binary projects specifically.

## Defined crates
 * Tokio ( Asynchronous Programming )
 * Anyhow ( Better Error Handling )
 * Rayon ( Introduced Parallelism )
 * Hashbrown ( Better HashMap replacement )
 * Chrono ( Date and Time )
 * Reqwest ( Highlevel HTTP Client )
  
### Personal Preference
 * Tempfile ( Temporary file management )
 * Colored ( Colored text in terminal simplified )
 * Clap ( Command Line Argument Parser )
